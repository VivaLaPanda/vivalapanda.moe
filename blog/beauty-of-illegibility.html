                    <b>Modern web design is highly oriented towards making the digital
                    environment maximally legible.</b> Designers want a site to be 
                    easy to use. They want users to be able to navigate to their 
                    destination in the minimum number of clicks. The designer wants
                    the discovery of new destinations to require as little effort 
                    as possible, relying on algorithmic suggestions in order to 
                    (quite effectively) direct the user towards content the user will 
                    enjoy.<br>
                    These are all things that seem like obviously good goals 
                    for a designer, and they grew out of an era where websites 
                    were often cluttered and confusing. A time when the lack of 
                    consistent interface idioms left new users unable to navigate 
                    around a site or piece of software. However, this change does 
                    not come without costs.

                    In Seeing Like a State, the redesign of Paris's streets is 
                    explored. The book notes that one major factor in the move 
                    to a more grid based design was the desire to increase 
                    legibility. A local of the city could move around easily, 
                    but if a new person came to a neighborhood they would find 
                    themselves lost without directions. The redesign to avoid 
                    this may have been for political reasons (making it easier 
                    for the army to crack down on dissidents), but it also was 
                    basically correct in observing that organic and illegible 
                    streets make the city harder for non-locals to navigate, 
                    and that it's possible to clear away that illegibility.
                    <br> 
                    The attitude of a legibility focused web designer can be 
                    seen through the same lens. Just like with cities though, 
                    this “modernization” is a tradeoff.

                    Generally speaking, the cities that people today find 
                    most beautiful are those that retain that old illegibility.<br> 
                    There's something intimate about wandering a narrow winding 
                    street, or hearing the chatter from a restaurant tucked away 
                    in an alley. These are places that demand not to simply 
                    be seen, but to be explored. Through that exploration, the 
                    places we discover are given additional weight. <br> 
                    Everyone who's lived in a city for a while has a few spots
                    that they grow some relationship with. A feeling that this 
                    restaurant or that park is a little secret, a secret shared 
                    when inviting a friend to experience that 
                    place with you.
                    There is something delightfully alive that 
                    is unique to a landscape one must wander through, to a place 
                    that reveals its secrets only through time. <br><b>This is the beauty 
                    of illegibility, the joy of adventure and exploration.</b><br> It 
                    is a beauty we should seek to recapture and to cultivate 
                    in our physical environment, a piece of the puzzle that we 
                    must balance against always seeking only greater convenience.<br> 
                    We can pursue this in our physical landscape, how we lay 
                    out our streets and design out buildings, but also in our 
                    digital landscape.

                    When you go back and look at archives of the 2000s era 
                    internet, there is something charming about it. Even with 
                    all of the things that today we would quickly decry as 
                    “bad design”, there is something to the chaos and color 
                    and irreverence that's appealing. It's the neon cacophony 
                    of old Times Square or Hong Kong:

                <p>
                    Part of what makes this era of the internet so charming 
                    is the inherent celebration of individuality and 
                    artistic expression, each website is a person's opportunity 
                    to show off and express themselves. But it goes 
                    beyond that. <br>
                    A piece of what makes these old sites fun 
                    is the inherent illegibility that pervades that early 
                    internet. Without decent search engines or social media, 
                    discovery of new websites is largely through direct 
                    recommendations on forums, or a friend messaging you 
                    about this cool site they just found. This illegibility 
                    adds a sense of adventure to the experience of using 
                    the internet, and a sense of place to each individual 
                    site. <br>
                    As the years pass, we have entered an era where 
                    the web is hyper-legible, and where the chaos of the 
                    individual is constrained by the centralized platforms 
                    we all rely on. I am not the first to note the 
                    “bootstrap-ening” of the web, and I'm sure I won't 
                    be the last. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What I am trying to get at, is that this 
                    change is more fundamental than a change in aesthetic 
                    sensibilities, or even an overall constraining of 
                    aesthetic freedom. The fundamental change is in the 
                    reformation of the 
                    internet into a place that sacrifices uniqueness and 
                    community scale in order to maximize the degree of 
                    ease with which a new person can discover and navigate 
                    across and within websites.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This change is probably 
                    a good thing for places like Wikipedia and Amazon, 
                    public spaces that serve a narrow purpose. It's good 
                    for them to be easily accessible to everyone! However, 
                    as more and more people spend more and more time 
                    online, we should consider whether we want not just 
                    our online stores, but our online neighborhoods and 
                    homes to also fall into this same pattern of being 
                    regularized and indexed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are small hints that we are naturally discovering 
                    this lack of obfuscation in our current platforms.<br> 
                    <a href="http://gather.town/" target="_blank">gather.town</a> 
                    throws simplicity away to form an online space that gives 
                    a greater feeling of place and transience. 
                    Discord's primary server mode is invite-only, with most 
                    servers sacrificing their “reach” in exchange for closer 
                    and more trusting communities. People are coming 
                    around to the idea that having all of your online 
                    experiences take place within logged, indexed, 
                    and constrained spaces isn't always great. <br>I think 
                    we'll continue to see this trend, with more and 
                    more online activity moving back into spaces 
                    that are obfuscated. Some will be private, some 
                    will be public, but they will have in common the 
                    reduction in how much of their content landscape 
                    can be seen “from above”, and how much of it must 
                    be discovered by exploring the alleyways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not calling for everyone who posts online to 
                    learn HTML and make their own websites instead of 
                    just using Twitter or whatever, though I do think 
                    many might enjoy it if they give it a shot. 
                    Instead, I'm just saying that as designers and as 
                    users, we should embrace a world that is not always 
                    legible. We should understand that sometimes 
                    adventure and uniqueness is just as important as 
                    ease-of-use.
